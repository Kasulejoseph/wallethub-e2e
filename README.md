## Testcase #1

Login to facebook and post a status message

## Testcase #2

Create a light user account in [URL](https://wallethub.com/join/light) and uncheck the checkbox to get your free credit score and report. This is the account you should be using for this test. Then simulate the following actions:

    1. Go to this [URL](https://wallethub.com/profile/13732055i)

    2. On the reviews section of the page, hover over the stars and click on the fourth star. Your code should actually (a) do the hover and (b) make sure the stars inside get lit up when you hover over them, then (c) click on the fourth star. Simply redirecting the WebDriver to the next page isn’t an option.

    3. On the page you get redirected to, click on the Policy dropdown and change the value to “Health Insurance”

    4. Click on the link “Write a review" and write some random text (minimum of 200 characters).

    5. Press submit

    6. If you are successful, you should see a confirmation screen saying you have reviewed the institution. You then have to go to your profile and confirm that the “review feed” got updated

    7. Go to [URL](https://wallethub.com/profile/) and assert that you can see the review.
